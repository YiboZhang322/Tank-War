## Evaluation Plan
### Evaluation Techniques
Our group will implement three major techniques to evaluate our game. Each team member need to find 4 participants.

Technique 1: Pre-Playing Game Survey
Before the participants play the game, we will present our game name, logo, and user interface. We will ask the participants:
1. Whether they would like to try this game.
2. What situation or time they will visit the game website and play it. (eg. play after exam, play when trouble falling asleep at night)
This techniques helps us to evaluate the attractiveness of the game concept and visual design in order to further improve our game design.

Technique 2: Testing and Observating Game Play
All participants will play the demo version of our game. And we will record the key data regarding to our game:
1. The time use of playing each level.
2. How many level they willing to play.
3. What level that cause a game over.
4. Do they need any help or instructions in playing the game.
This technique will help us to find the details of game we need to improve from the observation of game playing.

Technique 3: 
After the game play session, we will make a questionnaire for participants to answer:
1. Choose the level you most enjoyable. (1-10)
2. Choose a rate that you feel this game is simple or difficult to play(1-5)
3. Are you willing to play next time? (Yes/No)
4. What you want us to improve?
5. Choose a overall rate for this game.(1-5)
This technique helps us gather overall feedback on the game and determine whether we need to make improvements to make it more engaging.


### Participants:
We plan to find 12 participants for ourevaluation, each team member need to find 3 participants. 

Recuritment method:
2 participants will be recruited through unimelb, and 1 participant who are already had a job.

Our participants ensure we will collect enough information and they are representative of two different groups of people: Student and people started work.


### Data Collection: 
We will collet both quantitative data by numbers(eg. playtime for each level, game rate from 1-5...) and feedback by comments from participants.
We will Excel spreadsheet to record all the data we collect.


### Data Analysis:

We will analysis in two major ways:
1. By Quantitative number: We can indentify the areas the we need to impove, such as adjusting level duration and game difficulty.

2. From feedback and comments: We can evaluate the feedback to implement targeted improvements, such as adding visual effects which participants suggested, adding new object and game content that participants asked.


### Timeline:
13 Oct - 15 Oct: All team members have to complete the survey and questionnaire with their participants.

16 Oct: We will analysis the feedback and data, discuss what change we need to make in our game.

17 Oct - 19 Oct: All team members will continue to make this game, make some improvement from our previous discussion.


### Responsibilities:
Tong Jin: Complete the Survey, Discuss the improvement, Make the key change in game. Continue add new level in the game.

Yibo Zhang: Complete the Survey, make new contents for game, add game effects and game object, help to fix the game bug.
